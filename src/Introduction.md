Welcome to this Physics page! Here, physics concepts are approached using the **Entity-Component-System (ECS) Model**, a method used here to make learning and problem-solving more structured and efficient.
### What is the ECS Model?
The **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** model helps in organizing and solving complex problems by breaking them down into three key elements:

1. **Entity**: The object or subject in a physics problem (e.g., a rolling ball, a charged particle).
2. **Component**: The attributes or properties of the entity, such as mass, velocity, or position.
3. **System**: The rules and interactions that govern how these components behave, like Newton's laws of motion or Coulomb's law.

### How ECS Enhances Learning
By dissecting each problem into entities, components, and systems, the ECS model provides a clearer path to understanding and solving physics problems. It encourages breaking down complex scenarios into manageable parts, helping to build a deeper comprehension of the subject matterâ€”crucial for entrance exam success.
